I wrote the first version of VaultAtlas in 2001, when it was actually called
CDX, and written in Java. One of the first things it had was an importer
for plain-list tape lists, because that's what I was working with at the
time. I also seem to remember that CDX had the ability to store text files
for each show, as well as an exporter that created HTML files that I could
send to other people.

My source files for CDX were last touched in 2002 and I must have used the
tool until about 2006, when I decided to rewrite the program from scratch
using C#.

This new version used a .NET data set that would get serialized to an XML
file when you saved, and it had some nice filtering capabilities. Over time
I added the ability to read some basic FLAC metadata (again because FLAC is
all I use for audio).

I never gave out these tools except to one friend who used it to organize
his archival DVD collection, and very patiently lived with its bugs, even
as one bug left the entire XML file corrupted.

I am cleaning up the code once again, this time making the program available
to whoever wants to use it.

You can see that the controls were created using Visual Studio 2003 - the
WinForms designer did not create a partial designer class back then.
